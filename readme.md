SUMMARY
    Capitalist Incremental Engine Builder
        Basically, my previous project Incremental Engine Builder but with a capitalist theme.

TODO
    x simplify object strucutre - an array of { dec: {name: quantity}, inc: {name: quant}}
    x have cards generate randomly - only cards that you have the required from
    x restructure cards for spinning off

QUESTIONS

DESIGN
    The biggest issue with this design is that certain things probably can't be done automatically and still maintain systemic cohesion.
    What I'm thinking for this game is that players have a tableau that startsr off with 4 cards. Each card generates $1 per turn. 
    On your turn, you buy one of three cards OR pay to refresh.
    These cards convert stuff into other stuff.


    Land - there's a bit of ludonarrative dissonance to have forest generate 'forests' as opposed to trees but there's no parallel for mountains (veins?)
        Forest
            Money -> <x> Forests

    Capital
        Logs
            Forest & Lumberjacks -> Logs
    Labor
        Lumberjacks
            Money -> <x> Lumberjacks
MAYBE
    spin off the business into a separate entity (compress the tableau to a single card)
