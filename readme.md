DESIGN
    The biggest issue with this design is that certain things probably can't be done automatically and still maintain systemic cohesion.
    What I'm thinking for this game is that players have a tableau that startsr off with 4 cards. Each card generates $1 per turn. 
    On your turn, you buy one of three cards OR pay to refresh.
    These cards convert stuff into other stuff.


    Land
        Forest
            Money -> <x> Forests

    Capital
        Logs
            Forest & Lumberjacks -> Logs
    Labor
        Lumberjacks
            Money -> <x> Lumberjacks
MAYBE
